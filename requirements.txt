# Website Traffic Database - Data Generation Scripts
# This project uses only Python built-in modules for data generation

# Core Python modules used:
# - random (for generating random data)
# - datetime (for date/time operations)

# No external dependencies required
# All scripts use only Python standard library modules

Notes
SQL folder is good,
SRC folder only has data population scripts. After running the scripts, the SQL files were manually combined 
for the insertion sql file.
Need to understand the dashboard and visualization, need a better understanding of python, 
and also how we went from web traffic site to completed project. What did we do manually? 
What motivated those choices?
